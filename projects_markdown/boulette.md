This project came together from a desire to play Boulette (a fun take on Charades) with friends and family during these past years' lockdown. I designed it to play in conjunction with a video conferencing app of your choosing. It allows all remote players to interact with a shared pool of prompts, manage the teams, and keep track of the scores!

One of the main goals of this project was for the game to be played seamlessly and for the app to be interactive. Socket.io seemed like the ideal tool since it is "a JavaScript library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers." It ended up being exactly what I'd hoped, and it also allowed me to play around with some new tech!

This project was built using HTML, CSS, React, NodeJs and Socket.io

## Usage

All you need to do to get started is to load up the page, pick a username and create the room. From there you can either share the Room Id (found in the top right of the page) or the page's url with your friends. Once you've added a couple of prompts, you'll be able to get the game started.
