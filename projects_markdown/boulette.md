This project came together out of a desire to play _Boulette_ (a fun take on Charades) with friends and family during this past year's lockdown. It is designed to be used in conjunction with a video conferencing app of your choosing and allows all of the remote players to interact with a shared pool of prompts, to manage the teams and to keep track of the scores!

One of the main goals of this project was for the game to be played seamlessly and for the app to be interactive. Socket.io seemed like the ideal tool for the job since it is "a JavaScript library for realtime web applications. It enables realtime, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers." It ended up being exactly what I'd hoped and it also gave me the opportunity to play around with some new tech!

This project was built using HTML, CSS, React, NodeJs and Socket.io

## Usage

---

All you need to do to get started is to load up the page, pick a username and create the room. From there you can either share the Room Id (found in the top right of the page) or the page's url with your friends. Once you've added a couple of prompts you'll be able to get the game started.
